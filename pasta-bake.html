        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add penne and cook, stirring
                occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, reserving 1 cup cooking water.</li>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook onion in oil until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add garlic and cook for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in tomato sauce and tomato paste and cook until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add cream and Parmesan cheese. 
                Season with sugar, salt, and pepper.</li>
            <li>Stir some of the reserved pasta water into sauce and add cooked penne. Remove from the heat and stir in cherry tomatoes,
                 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese, and basil</li>
            <li> Add more pasta water if needed to reach desired consistency. Pour penne mixture into the 
                prepared baking dish and cover with remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
